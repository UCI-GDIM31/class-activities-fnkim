### W1
When you move the camera out of the cat, the camera stays still and you can see the cat moving around independently.
This is because the camera is no longer attached to the cat, and the screen will not move along with the cat.

### W2
The r, g, and b variables are floats because they are fractional numbers, not whole numbers, not words, and not in a true or false state. Meanwhile,
the _bounce variable is an int because it checks how many bounces there are, which can only be a whole number. Wgen I accidentally uncommented r += 0.1f
in step 2, the game wouldn't run because there was no semicolon.

### W3
In the visual novel, the parameters would be an int variable which checks the player's friendship level with the character, and a boolean variable that checks the flag of if the player knows the character's secret. The return type would be a string that contains the text response of the NPC.
